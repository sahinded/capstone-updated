In this project, I would like to predict possibility of catching second flight when there is a delay. Arrival delay can cause a problem to catch a connected flight. If there is a departure delay, there is a possibility not to have an arrival delay because of reducing elapse time on the air, but there is also possibility to have an arrival delay. There are different reasons to have arrival delay such that weather, departure delay, crowd of airport etc... Arrival delay becomes more important if you have another flight to catch since it can be messed up all of yoru plans. Everyone who are travelling by plane have missing flight experience at least one time since now, it cause not only loss money, time but also it is frustrating. Think about if you know your flight will be cancelled or do not have chance to catch your connected flight before your flight, everything will be changed. 

Flight delays cause not only inconvenience for airlines but for passengers.
